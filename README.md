## Project:  Clothes Forecast

This is an analog clock representation of what to wear based on the weather outside. There are two clock handles that point towards outerwear and acessories based on precipitation, respectively. It also has a digital LCD display component that displays the temperature outside at the moment which is updated every 10 minutes based on information pulled online from a weather API.
